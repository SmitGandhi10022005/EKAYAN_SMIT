# TASKMANAGER_SMIT
<br>
<h1>Above Programs Contains HTML, CSS & Javascript files of Task Manager</h1>
<br>
It Contains 4 HTML Pages in which the main page is taskmain.html...From that page, you can jump to adding, editing, and viewing your tasks.
<br>
I have given all page links in each HTML page so we don't have to jump to the main pages for each process.
<br>
On the add page, you have to select the user, task number, title, description, deadline of your task, and status. You cannot submit without filling in all the details.
<br>
On the edit page by selecting the user & task number you can view your task by mouseovering the button there. You can edit, remove & change the status of only existing tasks there.
<br>
On the task lists page select the user and on mouseover the show button you can see your tasks on the basis of your status("todo", "in-progress", "completed")
